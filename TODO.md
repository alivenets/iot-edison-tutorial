Barbot TODOs:
 V Implement `doCoctailStep` for real hardware
 V coctails.json: replace `duration` with `volume`, use coeffs for real pumps (volume/second)

 * Find out dependency between remaining fluid level and pumping duration
 * Implement UI for coctails editing
 * Implement UI for bottle names editing
